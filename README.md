# MovieApp
I built this project to futher my knowledge on react, useState, useEffect and working with an external API.
The external API that I used for this project to gather all movies is OMDb API.
The application allows you to search whatever movie you desire and allow you to add them to your favorites then save them to localstorage so they are always there when you re-open the app.
